My code plays 5 animations, each animation is connected to a button(via functions), and when the user pushes one of the buttons, the relevant animation plays. 

 1. The first animation is a smiley face that scrolls across the screen, this animations functions is 'happy'

2. The second animation is called pattern, this plays an animation where every other led is the same colour, and the ones in between are a random colour
   (within a limited range, so the colours are similar). The animations function is called 'pattern'
   
3. The third animation is snowday, this plays and animation where white leds move down the screen. The animations function is called 'snowday'

4. The fourth animation is rainbow, this plays an animation where each led is lit in sequence in a different colour, it uses hsv to go through the colours. 
   The animations function is called rainbow.
   
5. The fifth animation is blinking, this plays an animation where all the leds flash between red and blue. The animations function is called 'blinking'
